# best-practices

- Fixed style.py to follow all pep8 rules using pycodestyle

- fixed get_column_stats.py by removing the s character and 
    fixed the IndexError problem
    
- fixed imports on get_column_stats.py to comply with pep8

- improved basics_test.sh to ensure get_olumn_stats.py followed best practices
    by testing at the end, if the two files follow pycodestyle as well
    as randomizing the data entered
